# ThreeSnakeGames
A practice project for HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

The webpage allows a user to initialise three types of snake games - a default, a 4x, and a two player one.

It also allows the user to change the number of rows and columns the games are played with.

This helped with getting me familar with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, as well as pushed my ability as a programmer through having to create the logic of the snake game, as well as expand on it for the two-player version.
